GENERAL NOTES

* Time to Train & Test our Algorithms :
  ---------------------------------

     t0 = time()
	 < your clf.fit() line of code >
 	 print "training time:", round(time()-t0, 3), "s"


 * Python Numpy Array & Dictionary :
   -----------------
    -> A python dictionary canâ€™t be read directly into an sklearn classification or regression algorithm; instead, it needs a numpy array or a list of lists (each element of the list (itself a list) is a data point, and the elements of the smaller list are the features of that point).


 * List all the words in the TfIdf -> by calling `get_feature_names()` on it.


 * GridSearchCV is a way of systematically working through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validating as it goes to determine which tune gives the best performance. The beauty is that it can work through many combinations in only a couple extra lines of code.
