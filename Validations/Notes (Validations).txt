	  :- random_state (param)
	     ----
	      -> random_state controls which points go into the training set and which are used for testing; 
	      setting it to 42 means we know exactly which events are in which set, and can check the results you get

GridSearchCV

=> GridSearchCV is a way of systematically working through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validating as it goes to determine which tune gives the best performance. The beauty is that it can work through many combinations in only a couple extra lines of code.
